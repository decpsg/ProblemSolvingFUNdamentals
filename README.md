What should high school students know about computational problem solving?

Share your views about what high school (sec+jc) students should know about computational problem solving (data structures and algorithms that can be implemented in programming to solve computational problems that lend themselves to efficiency/complexity analysis).

What it will not cover:
- theory topics like computer architecture, network security, etc.
- applied topics like spreadsheets, databases and web application development

What it can include (maybe implicitly assumed) 
- computational thinking ideas
